We'll use the following numbering scheme for the buttons on the keypad:

```
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9
 ```

First, complete the task as normal.  Keep a note of the pattern that you repeat back to the game on the final step; we'll call this pattern `ABCDE`.

After receiving the `Calibration success` message, quickly type `6663232`.  (The game UI gives you two seconds to type after it shows the success message, or else it will close the task for you.)

Once you've typed that pattern, the system begins a game of Nim, with a single pile of `A + B + C + D + E + 5` objects.  On a player's turn, they may remove up to 9 objects from the pile.  The player to take the last object wins.  The system will always move first, and will always win if possible and will play randomly otherwise.  The simplest solution is to use the general solution to this game (i.e., reduce the remaining pile to the next lowest multiple of 10 on your turn if possible).  In the unlikely event that the system wins, you can type `6663232` again to restart the Nim game.
