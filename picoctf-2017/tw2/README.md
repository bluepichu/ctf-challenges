# Toaster Wars: Going Rogue, Episode 2 &mdash; Explorers of Toffee, Donuts, and Sugar&emsp;<sub><sup>Web, 120 points</sup></sub>

## Problem Description

Given the relative success of the first release, it was no surprise that a second installment in the TW:GR series was released. I can’t beat this one either, though... those darn spatulas put an induction cooktop in the floor so I can’t get to the flag! Can you get it for me?

_Hint: Toasters can’t go through induction cooktops because they’re made of metal. However, it looks like there’s a nice, friendly spatula on the last floor; and better yet, he’s made of rubber! I’m sure he could be persuaded to go pick up the flag and bring it back to you._

## Deployment

This problem can be deployed using the `docker-compose` setup in the `problem` directory.  There was no handout for this problem.

Some modifications that don't significantly affect the problem were made to the original code:

- The entire service was containerized
- Modifications were made to `db.js` and `init.js` to support having mongo in a separate container
