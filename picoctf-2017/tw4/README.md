# Toaster Wars: Going Rogue, Episode 4 &mdash; Super Toaster Wars&emsp;<sub><sup>Web, 200 points</sup></sub>

## Problem Description

Many saw the fourth installment of Toaster Wars: Going Rogue as a return to grace after the relative mediocrity of the third. Iâ€™m just glad it was made at all. And hey, they added some nifty new online scoreboard features, too!

_Hint: Ooh, what a nifty scoreboard! If we get a bunch of people playing at once, we can have a race through the dungeon!_

## Deployment

This problem can be deployed using the `docker-compose` setup in the `problem` directory.  There was no handout for this problem.

Some modifications that don't significantly affect the problem were made to the original code:

- The entire service was containerized
- Modifications were made to `db.js` and `init.js` to support having mongo in a separate container
