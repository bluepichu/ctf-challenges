# Toaster Wars: Going Rogue, Episode 1 &mdash; Appliance Rescue Team&emsp;<sub><sup>Web, 100 points</sup></sub>

## Problem Description

Oh, sweet, they made a spinoff game to Toaster Wars! That last room has a lot of flags in it though. I wonder which is the right one…?

_Hint: I think this game is running on a Node.js server. If it’s configured poorly, you may be able to access the server’s source. If my memory serves me correctly, Node servers have a special file that lists dependencies and a start command; maybe you can use that file to figure out where the other files are?_

## Deployment

This problem can be deployed using the `docker-compose` setup in the `problem` directory.  There was no handout for this problem.

Some modifications that don't significantly affect the problem were made to the original code:

- The entire service was containerized
- Modifications were made to `db.js` and `init.js` to support having mongo in a separate container
