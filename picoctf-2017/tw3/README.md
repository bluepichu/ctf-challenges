# Toaster Wars: Going Rogue, Episode 3 &mdash; Garnish to Infinity&emsp;<sub><sup>Web, 180 points</sup></sub>

## Problem Description

Many think the third entry in the Toaster Wars: Going Rogue series didn’t live up to Explorers due to its simplified gameplay, but I liked the new plot and ensemble cast better. Anyway, this one also has a flag that I can’t figure out how to get...

_Hint: Clearly, you can’t get to the flag. But perhaps you don’t need to get over to it at all?_

## Deployment

This problem can be deployed using the `docker-compose` setup in the `problem` directory.  There was no handout for this problem.

Some modifications that don't significantly affect the problem were made to the original code:

- The entire service was containerized
- Modifications were made to `db.js` and `init.js` to support having mongo in a separate container
